# Soroban smart contracts in Next.js
Soroban enables developers to build smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain, and incorporate the advanced assets and payment features of Stellar, in their own dApps. This tutorial shows how to invoke smart contracts from a simple web application, built with Next.js.

## Deploy Hello World smart contract
The default Hello World described in the documentation is used in this tutorial, without any modifications. All needed to setup and test bindings is a smart contract that can accept a text string and respond with a value. It’s less important what the smart contract actually does. For full installation guide see [Setup](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) or skip to the [Hello](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/hello-world) World section if the Stellar CLI is already installed.
